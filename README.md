💻 I have always been great with computers, I liked to make them apart.
🧑‍💻 But I never bothered to learn programming, I regreat it. So now I have started to learn
🎮 I started off with Unity. I had a little c# experience. I enjoyed it, but I wanted to know MORE

📹 I saw a video about the interviewing process. It was a fireship video and they started talking about fizzbuzz
⏸️ I paused immediately pulled up visual studio(I know and Im sorry but c# is nice in vs)
⌨️  I told myself, you can do that! I looked up fizzbuzz, saw the sudo code and went "yes I can!"

😞 Well, fun fact Unity doesnt really use stuff like fizzbuzz, I understand conditional statements.
😕 But I could not for the life of me understand the problem. I gave up after and hour and watched the video

👍 I dont understand javascript
🛠️ I watched the video. I tinkered with the code and all of a sudden IT WORKED
🔐 I locked in. I felt so good for this simple task, but I didnt look it up, something clicked and well
🤯 It clicked, I understood more, I made a calculator and a todo app with docs only.

🖱️ c# locked me into the windows environment, but I wanted to move to linux, so I jumped on the javascript train.

    and then................................RUST

🪦 I am too dumb for rust tbh, so I have taken to python to get better at systems and CLI coding... and I now make
   make fizz🐝 for every new programming language, because its my roots. god speed programmers!
